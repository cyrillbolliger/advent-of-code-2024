# Advent of Code 2024

Personal project to explore and learn [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) by 
solving some challenges of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Usage

1. Get the input from `https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/X/input` and copy it
   into a file named `input.txt` in the directory `src/main/dayX`, where `X` is 
   the day of the challenge. (As 
   [requested](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) by the author of the 
   challenges, the input files are not included in this repository.)

1. Run the project with the following command:
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```
